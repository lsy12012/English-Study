I think Korea doing their best effort to preserve and protect the local environment.

I talk about upper think from two perspectives(national perspective, personal perspective).

Since from long time ago, Korea was invaded by other countries many times.

At that situation, Korea ancient people was hide Cultural Heritage at deep mountain to prevent stolen.

In current times Korea admin Cultural Heritage such as '천연기념물', '인간문화재'

'인간문화재' is no looking Cultural Heritage that refer to song, dance knowing about ethnical history, concept.

To see personal perspective, 'Taean oil spill situation' is typical situation.

At 2007 years, two ship was collided at yellow sea, coast was covered by oil.

Experts was forcasted 10 years to restore.

But at that times, Korean people focused on and Korean did oil removal work directly on every holiday.

As a result, oil removal work completed in 2 months.

That's why I think Korea doing their best effort to preserve and protect the local environment.
