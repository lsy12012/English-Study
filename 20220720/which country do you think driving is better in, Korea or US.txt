I talk about why difficult to drive in Korea rather than USA
First, Korean passive is a impatient.
Get impatient because of horn from behind car in driving ambiguous situation, if little hesitate.
Second, driver's attitude taxi, bus on city road and truck, private tow truck on highway.
They almost didn't yield driving.
Especially, private tow truck ignore road situation for hang on accident car.
Finally, too many cars during rush hour and acciden road is often complicated.
