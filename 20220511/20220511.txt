From old times Korean Confucianism is be continued, this is connected to village culture, corporation culture, army culture and so on.

Korean respect old people and consider etiquette.

In Korean bus and Korean subway, there are seat for older people.

And my personally anecdote, when I was soldier 10 years ago, almost soldier's age between 20 ~ 22.

But two of my co-soldier's age is 29, 30 and one of my successor's age is 31.

In this case, executive gave treatment to them out of class because of their age.

There are many specific dialogue from Korean people like "How old are you?" or "I'm saying this for you~".

That dialog occur in fight situation or admonish from old people to young people situation regardless of casuality.

And one of not understanding culture is older people sensitive to chopstick skills.

When I was young, I got a scold from my father, because of chopstick skills.

Isn't the purpose of using chopsticks to pick up side dishes?

Each Korean people have own comfortable chopstick posture.

Forcibly correction for chopstick skills because of bad to see is not good my personally think.

As a result, best advantages of Korean culture is respect old people and consider etiquette.

worst advantages of Korean culture is follow age and make useless formality.
